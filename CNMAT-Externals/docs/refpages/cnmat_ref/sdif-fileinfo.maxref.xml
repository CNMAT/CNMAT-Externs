	Report information about the streams in an SDIF file

    <description>
	SDIF-fileinfo scans a file on disk and reports useful info out its outlets.  These data are different depending on the file accessed.

	    <description>
		The name of the SDIF-buffer.  Required because it has to be referenced by other objects in the SDIF suite.  The name of an SDIF-buffer is like the name of an MSP buffer~: it's a symbol that you assign as an argument to the SDIF-buffer object, and then other objects refer to the SDIF-buffer by its name.

		Read through all frame headers in an SDIF file to get info about the streams in the file.  If the object sees a name/value table (a 1NVT matrix in a 1NVT frame), it prints the contents to the Max window.  The file must be in Max's search path for this message to function.

		An SDIF stream is a matrix of data that can be queried, manipulated, and written.  The Sound Description Interchange Format (“SDIF”) offers a framework for representing high-level sound descriptions such as sum-of-sinusoids, noise bands, time-domain samples, and formants.  Many of these sound descriptions are mutable models, affording operations such as filtering, morphing, pitch shifting, and time stretching.  SDIF data consists of time-tagged frames, each containing one or more two-dimensional matrices of data such as floating-point numbers and a frame type ID indicating what kind of sound description the frame represents. For example, an SDIF frame representing additive synthesis data has a single matrix where rows represent individual sinusoids and columns represent parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and phase. A stream is a sequence of frames of the same frame type that represents a single “sonic object” evolving through time. An SDIF file may contain one stream, or multiple streams with interleaved frames. Each frame has a Stream ID, a meaningless 32-bit number that uniquely identifies the stream to which it belongs.
