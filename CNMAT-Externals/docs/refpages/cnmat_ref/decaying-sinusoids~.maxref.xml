    <digest>
	Bank of exponentially-decaying sinusoids
    </digest>

    <description>
	This object has a virtual time index used to compute the exponentially decaying sinusoid.  It allows the user to jump to a time in seconds. Time 0 is the beginning of the decay. Negative times are possible but dangerous because amplitudes <em>grow</em> exponentially as you go back from time 0.

    <!--DISCUSSION-->
    <discussion>
	Sets of sinusoids are specified as arguments or as a list. They are designated in groups of three floats: freq (Hz), gain, and decay rate (this format is also used by res-transform and resonators~).  Decaying-sinusoids~ can be substituted for resonators~ for impulsive excitations. An advantage of this object is its ability (via the included "time machine)" to play the impulse response forward and backwards (even before the beginning of time!).

	    <description>
		Set the minimum virtual time.  This can help alleviate issues associated with exponentially growing amplitudes as you jump back in time (with negative time designations).

	<method name="rate">
	    <arglist>
		<arg name="scalar" type="float" optional="0" id="0"/>
	    </arglist>
	    <description>
		This scalar updates all decay rates across all sinusoids in memory, and affects the behavior of the [goto] messages and signals in the way that the model will exponentially decay.

	<method name="signal">
	    <description>
		Control the time location (in seconds) of the object with a signal.  Rather than control virtual time with the "goto", "rate", "min_vtime", and "max_vtime" messages, you can send this signal as input for the virtual time (vtime).

		This object is designed for use with an object titled [timemachine~], which will be included in a future release.  Although this object assists in specifying the time index, the user is welcome to generate this signal as they like.  [decaying-sinusoids~] can be substituted for resonators~ for impulsive excitations. An advantage of this object is its ability (via [time machine]) to play the impulse response forward and backwards.
