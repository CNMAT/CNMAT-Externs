				to, so if something else has changed the cursor, you may not see a new 
				cursor if you set it to the previous argument to wind_setcursor().
				
				The solution is to call wind_setcursor(0) before calling it with the 
				desired cursor constant. Use wind_setcursor(-1) to tell Max youâ€™ll set 
				the cursor to your own cursor directly.
