/**	@file	cmmjl_tut_receivingErrors.txt
	@page	Receiving_errors Receiving Errors

The default behavior is for the cmmjl to post internal errors and debugging information to the Max window.  You can choose to receive this info as a call to a function in your object with this signature:

@code
void myobj_error(void *x, const char *objname, const char *filename, const char *function, int line, int code, char *reason_fmt);
@endcode

by calling 

@code
cmmjl_set_error_handler(myobj_error);
@endcode

This can be useful for "turning off" certain error messages or logging others to a file.

To turn error reporting off completely, call 

@code
cmmjl_set_no_error_handler();
@endcode

and to restore the default behavior, call

@code
cmmjl_set_default_error_handler();
@endcode

By default, only non-verbose errors are printed.  To turn verbose error reporting on, call

@code
cmmjl_set_verbose_error_handler();
@endcode
