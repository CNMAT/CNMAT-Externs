	@page	Parse_Full_Packet How to parse an OSC packet.

To parse an OSC packet, define a callback function with the ``A_GIMME'' signature and call cmmjl_osc_parseFullPacket() with that function as the last argument.  cmmjl_osc_parseFullPacket() has the following signature:

@code
t_cmmjl_error cmmjl_osc_parseFullPacket(void *x, long n, long ptr, void(*cbk)(void *x, t_symbol *sym, int argv, t_atom *argc))
@endcode

where x is a pointer to your object, n is the length in bytes, ptr is a pointer to the OSC data, and cbk is the callback to be used as the messages are extracted from the packet.

@code

void myobj_oscCallback(void *x, t_symbol *msg, long argc, t_atom *argv){
	// do something with the messages here
}

void myobj_fullpacket(t_myobj *x, long n, long, ptr){
	cmmjl_osc_parseFullPacket(x, (char *)ptr, n, true, myobj_oscCallback);
}
@endcode
