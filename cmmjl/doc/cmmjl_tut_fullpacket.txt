@page	tut_fullpacket	How to add support for the "FullPacket" message to your object.

You can add support for the ``FullPacket'' message to your object fairly easily by calling CMMJL_ACCEPT_FULLPACKET() in your main routine.  When an OSC packet is received, by default, the last segment of each OSC address will be passed to your object as a message (see below).

You will need to include cmmjl_osc.h along with cmmjl.h:
@code
#include "cmmjl.h"
#include "cmmjl_osc.h"
@endcode

In the main() routine, after calling cmmjl_init(), call the macro CMMJL_ACCEPT_FULLPACKET().
@code
int main(void){
	t_class *c;
	...
	CMMJL_ACCEPT_FULLPACKET(c, NULL);
	...
}
@endcode

The first argument should be a pointer to your class and the second argument should be NULL to use the default callback, cmmjl_osc_fullpacket().  When a "FullPacket" message is received, cmmjl_osc_fullpacket() strips off all but the last segment of the OSC message and then attempts to send that message along with the parameters of the OSC message to your object (see cmmjl_osc_sendMsg()).

Example:
If the OSC packet contains /foo/bar 34 12.3, a message called "bar" will be sent to your object with the arguments 34 and 12.3, if your object accepts a message called "bar."

If you want to define some other behavior when the "FullPacket" message is received, you can define a function with the signature

@code
void fullpacket(void *, long, long)
@endcode

and pass that to CMMJL_ACCEPT_FULLPACKET() as the second argument:

@code
CMMJL_ACCEPT_FULLPACKET(c, fullpacket);
@endcode
