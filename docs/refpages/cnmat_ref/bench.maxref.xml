	Simple benchmarking utility.		
    </digest>

    <description>
	bench allows you to benchmark the speed of various processes running through it, utilizing your CPU's cycle counter as the reference time.  You use bench by instantiating two copies of it - one for the <i>input</i> to be measured, and one for the <i>output</i>.  These must be two separate bench objects, similar to Max's <m>tapin~</m> and <m>tapout~</m> objects.  When something arrives in the left inlet of an <i>input</i> bench object, the <i>input</i> object outputs a reference time out the right outlet, which should be connected to the right inlet of the <i>output</i> object.  The <i>output</i> object simply stores that time.  The <i>input</i> object then outputs the message, which presumably will occupy some time to process.  Once this process has been completed, a bang can be issued to the <i>output</i> object's left inlet, which will consequentially check the current time vs the input time, and output the difference.  The output of the <i>output</i> bench object is a measurement in milliseconds: a record of how long it took to perform a task between the input and the output.
