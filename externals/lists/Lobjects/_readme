Lobjects source readme

This folder contains source code for most of the Lobjects.
I'm posting it all as is, no garuantees, put microsoft level disclamers here.

There aren't a lot of comments, and the comments aren't always right.

Many of them have been through five reincarnations, and the changes 
from one system to another have left some strange twists. That's why
checkInlet(x), for instance.

They all build with no warnings, and they work, so the the code must be 
reasonably clean, but I don't hold them up as a model of elegant coding.
They are simply something that works for me.
