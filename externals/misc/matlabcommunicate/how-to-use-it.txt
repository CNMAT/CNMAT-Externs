Go to a bash shell and set the shell variables MATLAB, DVLD_LIBRARY_PATH, and PATH.
Then start Max from this terminal:

bash
MATLAB=/Applications/Matlab
export MATLAB
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MATLAB/bin/mac:$MATLAB/sys/os/mac:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
PATH=/Applications/Matlab/bin:$PATH
export PATH
open /Applications/MaxMSP\ 4.5/MaxMSP\ 4.5




For Remote:

Start the X server on your machine
xhost +[ip_address_of_matlab_server]
Make sure your path on the matlab server includes the Matlab directory

Type this in a terminal on my laptop to run Matlab on the G5:
ssh 128.32.122.217 "/bin/csh -c 'setenv DISPLAY 128.32.122.70:0; matlab'"
