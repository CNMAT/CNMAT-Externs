* Open Issues
** Bugs
*** General
**** BUG All objects need to handle naked (valid) OSC messages and convert them to bundles.
*** o.accumulate
*** o.expr
**** BUG Syntax error when compiling multiple expressions and the last one ends with a semicolon.
**** BUG modulo (%) doesn't print properly when sending the post-functions message
*** o.prepend
*** o.route
*** o.rename
**** BUG o.rename doesn't handle partial matches correctly
*** o.union/intersection/difference
**** BUG duplicate addresses in the same input bundle are not removed.
*** o.message
** Feature Requests
*** General
**** TODO Overview / tutorial patches
**** TODO Boolean values become signed 1-bit values: 00=0, 01=1, 11=-1
**** TODO Support for blobs
**** TODO Support for 16-bit floats (half float)
**** TODO Postfix type specifiers
**** TODO o.var should support a single message as an argument (for multiple messages, use o.message)
**** TODO A tokenizer to tokenize a string and turn it into OSC would be nice
**** TODO libo and libomax versions need to be reported.
**** TODO Make sure assist strings are working for all objects
**** TODO Explicit way to convert bundle to naked OSC message
**** TODO Objects should filter duplicate addresses (o.accumulate, o.pa(c)k, o.mappatch, o.message, o.union, o.intersection, o.difference.
**** TODO Implement error handler
**** TODO Constants need to be checked for accuracy at all precisions
**** TODO All formatting code needs to be refactored 
*** o.message
*** o.expr
**** TODO if() should be a special case of cond and we should have when and unless
**** TODO Change t_osc_expr_rec to support better documentation of function parameters
**** WAITING Codebox
**** TODO you get odd results with the ? : business if you don't add whitespace in the right place.
**** TODO o.expr documentation strings need to be available in max so you can build menus, etc.
**** TODO ignore # arguments
**** TODO settypetags() should work like the cast functions
*** o.if
*** o.printbytes
**** TODO Add explicit NULL bytes (instead of printing nothing)
**** TODO Better formatting in general
*** o.print
**** TODO o.print should print any max messages
*** new objects
**** TODO o.typetages: outputs the typetags.
**** TODO o.append
**** TODO o.gensym
** Design questions
*** The fact that o.route can output both bundles and Max data is a source of bugs.  Rewrite o.route?  
New objects with more explicit behavior?
* VERSION
** Bugs Fixed
** Changelog
*** o.expr
**** TODO constant_array() => nfill()
**** DONE typetags(): return a list of typetags
**** DONE eval() should return an error code, not the results of the evaluation
Currently this is likely to be a 0 for success and a 1 in the event of an error
**** DONE Check for negative index values in index lookup.
**** DONE /foo[[1:4] ] = ... (set a range of values using matlab syntax)
* VERSION 1.0.7.1a
Released: [2012-01-15 Sun]
** Bugs Fixed
*** FIXED Changing the osc_atom* formatting code so that strings have quotes around them broke o.expr's parser.  
* VERSION 1.0.7a
Released: [2012-01-15 Sun]
** Bugs Fixed
*** o.message
**** DONE After typing, o.message should read the contents of the text field, parse them, format them, and then place them back in the text field so that things like trailing decimals and quotes are displayed correctly.
**** FIXED o.message should display strings with quotes around them
**** FIXED [o.message 1 2 3.0 thing "hello" "thang thong"] not outputting the right thing
This was due to the null byte at the end of quoted strings not being set.
** Changelog
* VERSION 1.0.6a
Released: [2012-01-14 Sat]
** Bugs Fixed
** Changelog
*** DONE float(), double(), char() as aliases for float32(), float64(), and int8()
*** DONE Support for int8, uint8, int16, uint16.
*** o.expr
**** DONE Assignment to elements of an array: /foo[ [ 2 ]] = 20.
* VERSION 1.0.5a
Released: [2012-01-13 Fri]
** Name changes
*** DONE o.call => o.callpatch
*** DONE o.accumulate => o.collect
*** DONE o.spew => o.atomize
** Bugs Fixed
*** o.message
**** FIXED o.message doesn't display floats like x.0 correctly--the trailing decimal doesn't show up.
**** FIXED bug that causes o.message to no longer do $-substitution if the input is a symbol.
**** FIXED set with nothing after it should clear the o.message
*** o.expr
**** FIXED range() will crash when creating an infinite range (range(1, 10, -1))
**** FIXED scale documentation string is wrong.
**** FIXED C's mod op is wrong and should be replaced with this:  mod(x, m) = x - m * sign(m) * floor(x / abs(m))
** Changelog
*** Patches updated to reflect object name changes.
*** o.expr
**** DONE Explicit cast functions (int32(), int64(), uint32(), uint64(), float32(), float64(), string())
**** DONE make mod() as well as %
**** DONE list() and [] list construction
**** DONE emptybundle()
**** DONE change defined() to bound()
**** DONE make-list becomes constant-array(<constant>, <n>)
* VERSION 1.0.4a
Released: [2012-01-09 Mon]
** Bugs Fixed
*** FIXED o.expr only evaluating the first function if there is more than one.
*** FIXED o.route outlets in wrong order when input is Max message
*** FIXED Crash when sending clear (or any other non-OSC message)
** Changelog
*** DONE Constants should be implemented as functions.
* VERSION 1.0.3a
Released: [2012-01-08 Sun]
** Bugs Fixed
*** o.expr
**** FIXED [o.expr /count++ %= 8] crashes.  It doesn't compile and doesn't generate an error, but
/count++ is not a valid lvalue
*** o.route
**** FIXED Crash when sending an OSC-style Max message that doesn't get matched.
** Changelog
*** DONE New object: o.cond (generalization of o.if)
*** DONE New objects: o.when and o.unless
*** DONE Include Rama's improved help files
* VERSION 1.0.2a
Released: [2012-01-06 Fri 13:10]
** Bugs Fixed
** Changelog
*** DONE Version and copyright string should be reported once when the first odot obj is instantiated.
*** DONE Individual objects should not have their own version numbers---there should a single version for the entire odot lib.
*** DONE OSC boolean types should be converted to ints when sent out into Max
* VERSION 1.0.1a
Released: [2012-01-05 Thu]
** Changelog
** Bugs Fixed
*** FIXED Crash with this business:
1   edu.cnmat.berkeley.o.prepend        0x0c2b8eb6 osc_message_s_renameCopy + 198
2   edu.cnmat.berkeley.o.prepend        0x0c2b3fba oppnd_doFullPacket + 362
3   edu.cnmat.berkeley.o.prepend        0x0c2b39bd oppnd_fullPacket + 45
* VERSION 1.0a
Released: [2012-01-05 Thu]
** Changelog
*** DONE Check on o.mappatch's handling of nested bundles
*** o.var no longer accepts @op union/intersection/difference attributes,
use o.union, o.intersecsion, o.difference
*** o.b(u)ild is now o.pa(c)k
*** Most (all?) objects now support nested bundles
*** Numerous bug fixes and improvements
