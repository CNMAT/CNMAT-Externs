\
This patch is designed to work with the P5 Glove made by Essential Reality.  I am in no way affiliated with Essential Reality.\
\

\f1\b **This patch will not work without P5osc, a Mac OSX driver for the glove by Tim Kreger.  If you don't have it, you can download it at www.listen.to/simulus**
\f0\b0 \
\
Special thanks to Greg Thompson for his glove calibration system.... very handy! :)\
\

\f1\b ABOUT
\f0\b0 \
\
The P5 Glove Midi Assigner is designed to allow the user to map the X, Y, and Z axis, finger sensors, and buttons of the P5 Glove to standard MIDI CC# so that the glove may be used as an alternate controller.\
\
**This patch will NOT work unless the enclosed driver "p5osc" is launched first.**\
\
This software was developed in Max/MSP.  (www.cycling74.com)\
\
**SPECIAL MAX/MSP NOTE: All outputs have been wired to "send" objects for easy integration in to larger Max/MSP patches.**\
\

\f1\b TO USE
\f0\b0 \
\
***NOTE: Before launching P5 MIDI Assigner, you must first plug in the glove and launch the enclosed driver "P5osc"**\
\
\ul OVERVIEW:\
\ulnone 1. Launch P5Osc\
2. Launch P5 Glove MIDI Assigner\
3. Calibrate the glove.\
4. Load a preset file (if applicable).\
5. Assign output parameters.\
6. Assign MIDI output.\
7. Enable Glove output.\
8. Use glove.\
\
\ul CALIBRATION:\ulnone \
Before using the glove it is essential to calibrate it.  This allows you to set the minimum and maximum range for all the parameters.\
\
1. Open the Calibration page by clicking on the "Calibrate Glove First!" Button.\
2. In the calibration window, enable "calibration mode" by clicking the checkbox.\
3. Calibrate the Glove\
	A.  The "C" button scrolls through the different parameters (current parameter 	is indicated on the left).\
	B.  Move the glove to the minimum location (ie. for the X-axis, all the way to 	the left) and press the "A" button.  This will set that position as the absolute 	minimum.\
	C.  Move the glove to the maximum location (ie. for the X-axis, all the way to 	the right) and press the "B" button.  This will set that position as the absolute 	maximum.\
	D.  Look at the "output" section for the chosen parameter.  As you move the 	glove from the absolute minimum to the absolute maximum, the output 		should show full MIDI scale (0-127).  If not, repeat steps B & C.\
	E.  Press the "C" button to move to the next parameter and repeat.\
**Note:  Buttons do not need to be calibrated, but you can verify that they are working correctly from this screen.**\
\
4.  Once the glove has been calibrated, make sure to DISABLE calibration (by de-selecting the checkbox) and close the window.\
\
\ul MIDI ASSIGNMENT:\
\ulnone From the P5 Glove Midi Assigner main screen, you can assign each glove parameter to MIDI control.\
\
Make sure to select a MIDI output port from the drop-down menu.\
\
**No MIDI data will be sent unless "Enable Glove Output" is selected.**\
\
1.  "Set Range":  This parameter allows you to limit the control values coming out from that parameter.  If set to full, the "Value Out" will go from 0-127.  Using this range bar, you can limit the output range.  The scaled output is shown in "Value Out"; This is the control value that is sent via MIDI.\
\
2.  "Controller Number/MIDI Channel":  This is where you set the MIDI output of the parameter.  You can click and type directly into the boxes, or click and drag.\
\
3.  "Assign Note Outs": Buttons A, B, and C have been configured to trigger note out messages.  Enter in the MIDI note numbers (up to 4, with NO commas), and set the velocity, duration (in milliseconds), and output channel.\
\

\f1\b PRESETS
\f0\b0 \
\
All parameters are saved, including controller numbers, MIDI channels, range, note out lists, velocity, and duration.  Each preset is a numbered patch, and a collection of numbered patches forms a preset file.  These preset files are saved in .XML format.\
  \
However, it is important to CALIBRATE the glove EVERY TIME you launch the program.\
\
\ul To Save A Preset\ulnone \
Set the "Preset Number" to the desired location and click the "Save Preset" Button.\
\
\ul Load A Preset\
\ulnone Set the "Preset Number" to the desired location and click the "Load Preset"\
\
\ul Save a Preset File\
\ulnone Click the "Save Preset File" button.  You will be prompted to name the file and choose a storage location.\
**NOTE: You will be automatically prompted to Save your preset file upon exiting the program.**\
\
\ul Load a Preset File\
\ulnone Click the "Load Preset File" button.  You will be prompted to find your stored preset file.\
